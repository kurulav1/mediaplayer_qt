#####Scope
 * The project scope seems ok.
 * Good to see that you have considered the minimal and optional features separately.
 * I would've wanted to see more dates in your schedule, but you've considered the dependencies and order of the features well.

#####High-level structure
 * Nice image of the planned UI.
 * Class diagrams are nice and detailed
 * Your understanding about some of the internal Qt concepts gives a feel you have studied them when writing the plan or you have previous experience, nice!
 
#####External libraries
 * Looking good - though remember to check if Qt has many features built into its framework, unit testing for example. You might not actually need other external libraries unless you plan to develop some advanced features.

#####Division of work and responsibilities
 * Looking alright, though a bit vague.
 * I would've liked to see the responsibility division between all the members separately. Remember to have this fixed in the project documentation.

#####Plan score: 3p
